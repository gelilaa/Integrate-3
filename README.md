### integrate-3 
It is A basic web page with semantic layout, developed collaboratively using branches.  
It's not very interesting to look at.

The group workflow will be like this:

1. Choose one of you to be the repository owner, they will complete _step 0_ of the development strategy.
    - Your repo should have: a `development-strategy`, one issue per step, each issue assigned to someone, and a project board for the issues

1. Using  workflow, each member of the team will complete their assigned issues:
    - Move your issue into "In Progress"
    - Complete your task on a separate branch on your local machine
    - When you have checked all the boxes, push your branch to GitHub
    - Open a Pull Request and request a review from your team mates
    - link your PR to your issue 
    - Move your issue into "Ready for Review"
1. Once everyone has created their PRs, review each PR as a group
    
##  How was this process?

Codit 19 had so much fun with collaborating and working together. Everyone in the team has done what they supposed to do on the project.

Communication b/n the team members was great. Everybody know what their team mates were up to and can follow the updates.

## Did you get conflicts? 

 we have encountered some conflicts on the project. But it was expected since 2-3 people were working in one index file. 

  So for that reason, whoever was assigned to review the pull request he or she must fix the conflict and merge the branch.
